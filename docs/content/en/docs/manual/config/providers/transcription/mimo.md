MiMo uses its native audio understanding model to complete speech transcription.

::: info Why choose Xiaomi MiMo?
If you already use MiMo, or want to use its multimodal model to process audio content, you can choose this service provider.
:::

## Obtain API Key

1. Log in to [Xiaomi MiMo Platform](https://platform.xiaomimimo.com/), then confirm that the account has API access enabled.
2. Create an API Key, copy it and keep it in a safe place.

::: warning API Key and audio data
Do not expose the API Key. Cloud transcription sends audio to the provider for processing, so confirm that this meets your privacy and data-handling requirements.
:::

## Configure in AIRI

1. Fill in the API Key in **Settings → Providers → Transcription → Xiaomi MiMo**.
2. Keep the default Base URL: `https://api.xiaomimimo.com/v1/`, unless the service provider provides another address.

## Verify configuration

1. Select an available transcription model in the provider settings.
2. Use the playground on the same page, allow microphone access, and record a short sample to confirm that text is returned.

## Enable microphone transcription

Open **Settings → Modules → Hearing**, select **Xiaomi MiMo**, choose model ID `mimo-v2-omni`, then choose a microphone and run the Hearing test. Testing the provider page alone does not enable microphone transcription.

## Troubleshooting

If a request fails, check the API key, model selection, and network connection. If no text is returned, confirm that AIRI has microphone permission.

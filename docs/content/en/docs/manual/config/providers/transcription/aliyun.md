description: Configure Alibaba Cloud Intelligent Voice Interaction Service (ASR) in AIRI
---

Alibaba Cloud NLS provides AIRI with real-time speech-to-text (ASR). After completing the configuration, select **Aliyun NLS** under **Settings → Modules → Hearing** and test the microphone input.

::: info Why choose Alibaba Cloud NLS?
If you already use an Alibaba Cloud account and need real-time speech recognition capabilities, you can choose Alibaba Cloud NLS.

## Prepare credentials

1. In [Alibaba Cloud Intelligent Voice Interaction Console](https://nls-portal.console.aliyun.com/overview) enable the service, create a project, and copy its **AppKey**.
2. Create a RAM user AccessKey with the required permissions in **AccessKey Management**.
3. Copy **AccessKey ID** and **AccessKey Secret**; the Secret will usually only be displayed in full once.

::: warning AccessKey Security
Do not commit the AccessKey ID, AccessKey Secret, or AppKey, include them in screenshots, or share them with anyone. Grant the RAM user only the required permissions. If credentials are exposed, disable them and create replacements in the Alibaba Cloud console immediately.
:::

## Configure in AIRI

1. Open **Settings → Providers → Transcription → Aliyun NLS**.
2. Fill in the **AccessKey ID**, **AccessKey Secret** and **AppKey**.
3. Select the area closest to you, such as East China `cn-shanghai`, North China `cn-beijing` or South China `cn-shenzhen`.

## Verify configuration

1. The confirmation page prompts that the basic credentials verification has passed.
2. Select **Aliyun NLS** and an audio input device under **Settings → Modules → Hearing**.
3. Click "Start Monitoring" and then speak into the microphone or play an audio clip.
4. Confirm that the text can be output in real time in the transcription area; if the recognition result is inaccurate, you can adjust the sensitivity and test again.

## Troubleshooting

If credential verification fails, confirm that all three credentials come from the same Alibaba Cloud account and project, then check the RAM user permissions. If no text appears, confirm that the operating system has granted AIRI microphone access.

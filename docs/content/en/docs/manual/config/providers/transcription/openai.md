description: Configuring OpenAI or an OpenAI-compatible API as a speech recognition provider in AIRI
---

This page configures an OpenAI-compatible transcription API. After saving it, select the provider and model under **Settings → Modules → Hearing** and test microphone input.

::: info Why use an OpenAI-compatible API for ASR/STT?
If your transcription provider implements the OpenAI transcription API, follow this guide to connect it to AIRI. An API address ending with `/v1` or a key starting with `sk-` does not by itself guarantee compatibility.
:::

## Obtain API Key

1. Log in to the management console of the selected service provider.
2. Create an API Key on the API Key or Developer Settings page.
3. Copy the key and keep it in a safe place.

::: warning API Key Security
Do not commit the API key, include it in screenshots, or share it with anyone. Once a key is compromised, immediately revoke it and create a new key in the provider console.
:::

## Configure in AIRI

1. Open **Settings → Providers → Transcription → OpenAI Compatible**.
2. Fill in the API Key and the ASR/STT model ID to be used.
3. For official OpenAI, select the separate **OpenAI** provider. The **OpenAI Compatible** provider has no default Base URL; enter the complete API root documented by the compatible service.

## Verify configuration

1. Select the configured service provider and model in **Settings → Modules → Hearing**, then select the audio input device.
2. Click **Start Monitoring**, then speak into the microphone or play an audio clip.
3. Confirm that text appears in the transcription area. If recognition is inaccurate, adjust the sensitivity and test again.

## Troubleshooting

If there is no text result, confirm that AIRI has microphone permission. For a compatible service, verify that it implements the OpenAI transcription API and supports the entered model ID.

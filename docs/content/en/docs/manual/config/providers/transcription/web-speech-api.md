description: Using in-browser speech recognition with AIRI Web
---

The Web Speech API uses the browser's built-in speech-recognition capability and does not require an API key.

::: info Why choose Web Speech API?
If you're just trying out speech input quickly on the web, and your browser supports the Web Speech API, this is the minimal configuration option.
:::

## Confirm browser support

1. Use AIRI Web. The Web Speech API provider is not available in the Desktop ver. (Electron).
2. Confirm that the current browser supports the Web Speech API and is ready to allow microphone permissions.

::: warning Browser restrictions
The Web Speech API is only available in browser environments and is not supported by the desktop version of AIRI (Electron). Recognition capabilities may vary across browsers, network environments and languages.
:::

## Configure in AIRI

1. Open **Settings → Providers → Transcription → Web Speech API** in the web version.
2. Select **Recognition Language**, then configure **Continuous Recognition** and **Show Interim Results** as needed.

## Verify configuration

1. Go to **Settings → Modules → Hearing** and select Web Speech API and Audio Input Device.
2. Allow the browser to access the microphone and start a short voice input test.
3. Confirm that the transcription appears in AIRI.

## Troubleshooting

If no transcription appears, check the browser's microphone permission, the selected input device, and the recognition language. If your browser does not support this API, use a local or cloud transcription provider instead.

description: Configuring Alibaba Cloud Bailian speech synthesis in AIRI
---

Alibaba Cloud Bailian provides the CosyVoice speech synthesis model in AIRI.

::: info Why choose Alibaba Cloud Bailian?
If you already use Alibaba Cloud Model Studio and want to choose among CosyVoice voices and models, this is the direct access method.
:::

## Obtain API Key

1. Log in to [Alibaba Cloud Bailian Console](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/), then confirm that the model service is enabled.
2. Create a key on the API Key management page.
3. Copy the key and keep it in a safe place.

::: warning API Key Security
Do not commit the Bailian API key, include it in screenshots, or share it with anyone.
:::

## Configure in AIRI

1. Open **Settings → Providers → Speech → Alibaba Cloud Model Studio**.
2. Enter the Model Studio API key. The default Base URL is the AIRI/UnSpeech gateway at `https://unspeech.hyp3r.link/v1/`, not Alibaba Cloud's direct API. Your key, text to synthesize, model/voice selection, and returned audio pass through this gateway. Use it only if you accept that trust boundary; otherwise enter a compatible self-hosted gateway URL or choose a direct provider.

## Verify configuration

1. Select an available voice in the provider playground. This page uses AIRI's default CosyVoice model.
2. Use the playground on the same page to enter a short text and confirm that audio plays.

## Enable for AIRI replies

Open **Settings → Modules → Speech**, select **Alibaba Cloud Model Studio**, then select an available model and voice. The provider playground tests credentials; this module selection is what enables speech for normal AIRI replies.

## Troubleshooting

If the playground cannot complete a request, check the API key, Model Studio billing and quota status, rate limits, and network connection. If a model or voice is unavailable, confirm that the corresponding model service is enabled for the Bailian account.

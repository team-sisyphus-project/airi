## Check available Flux

Flux is the balance used by AIRI official services. Any initial grant is configured by the current deployment, so check the balance shown in **Settings → Flux** rather than assuming a fixed amount.

## Enable the provider

1. Open **Settings → Modules → Consciousness**.
2. Select **Official Provider** and the **Auto** model.
3. Send a short message and confirm that AIRI replies.

AIRI selects the official provider automatically only when no chat provider is already active. If you previously selected another provider, signing in does not replace that selection.

## Charge Flux

Open **Settings → Flux** and choose an available package. On desktop, AIRI opens checkout in the system browser and refreshes the balance when the app regains focus. Builds or deployments with purchasing disabled do not offer checkout.

## Troubleshooting

If you do not receive the sign-in email, check your spam folder. If Flux packages are unavailable or checkout cannot be created, purchasing may be disabled for that deployment or temporarily unavailable.

description: Configure OpenPaths as a chat provider in AIRI
is_openai_compatible: true
---

OpenPaths is a chat API provider compatible with the OpenAI format. After completing the configuration on this page, AIRI can use OpenPaths models in **Consciousness**.

::: info Why OpenPaths?
If you already have an OpenPaths API Key, or want to use the model it provides, you can choose this service provider directly.
:::

## Get the API key

1. Go to [OpenPaths](https://openpaths.io/) to register an account and create an API Key.
2. Copy the key and keep it in a safe place.

::: warning API Key Security
Do not commit the API key, include it in screenshots, or share it with anyone. Once a key is compromised, immediately revoke it and create a new key in the OpenPaths console.
:::

## Configure in AIRI

1. Open **Settings → Providers → Chat → OpenPaths**.
2. Paste the API Key into the basic settings.
3. Keep the default Base URL: `https://openpaths.io/v1`.

## Verify configuration

1. **Validate configuration**: AIRI validates the configuration automatically as you edit it. If **Ping API** appears, use it for a live request test.
2. **Select Model →**: After validation succeeds, use this button to open **Settings → Modules → Consciousness**, then select the provider and model.

## Troubleshooting

If the API check fails, verify the API key, available credit or quota, rate limits, and network connection. If AIRI cannot load the model list, enter the exact model ID provided by OpenPaths manually on the **Consciousness** page.

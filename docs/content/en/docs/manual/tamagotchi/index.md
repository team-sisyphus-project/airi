## Start chatting first

After installing and starting AIRI, complete the onboarding flow:

1. On the welcome screen, optionally click the <span class="i-lucide:globe inline-block align-[-0.125em]" aria-hidden="true"></span> **globe button** in the upper-right corner to change the interface language.
2. Select **Setup with your provider**, or select **Sign in** to use the official AIRI provider.
3. Select a Chat provider such as OpenRouter, OpenAI Compatible, DeepSeek, Ollama, Google Gemini, or Anthropic.
4. Fill in the API Key, local service address and other necessary information.
5. Select a chat model, then select **Save and Continue**.
6. After returning to the main character window, click **Expand** in the Controls Island in the lower-right corner.
7. Click **Open Chat**, enter the message and send it.

::: tip Using Ollama locally?
By default, Ollama allows requests from the development and packaged-app origins of the Desktop ver. Thus, a local setup does not usually require `OLLAMA_ORIGINS`. If a CORS error occurs from a non-default remote web origin, add that exact origin to `OLLAMA_ORIGINS`. Then restart Ollama. Do not use a wildcard or expose Ollama to the public internet.

## What will you see

The Desktop ver. usually consists of these interfaces:

- **Main Character Window**: A desktop-resident character stage supporting Live2D, Spine, VRM, MMD, and Tachie.
- **Controls Island**: A small group of buttons in the lower-right corner of the main character window.
- **Chat Window**: A conversation window opened from the Controls Island.
- **Settings Window**: Configure providers, profiles, models, modules, data, connections, and system options.
- **System Tray Menu**: Adjust the window size and position, open settings, manage captions and widgets, or quit AIRI.

If the main character window is hidden, you can bring it back by clicking on the AIRI tray icon or selecting **Show** in the tray menu.

## Controls Island

The Controls Island is the main entry point for everyday use of the desktop app.

- Click **Expand** to show more actions.
- Click **Open Chat** to open the chat window.
- Click **Open settings** to configure providers, models, modules, profiles, and system settings.
- Click **Switch Profile** to change the current character card.
- If needed, you can click **Refresh** to reload the stage.
- Click the light/dark icon to switch themes.
- Click the pushpin icon to toggle **Pin on top**.
- Click the eye icon to toggle **Auto hide** / **Always show**.
- Click **Open hearing Controls** to open voice-input controls.
- Drag **Drag to move window** to move the main character window.

## Hide on hover

The eye icon controls whether AIRI remains fully interactive or fades out of the way to reduce obstruction while you work.

- **Always show** keeps the character visible and clickable.
- **Auto hide** fades the character and interface when the cursor is close, making it easier to click the application below.

When you first enable hide on hover, AIRI displays a short explanation. If it becomes difficult to click AIRI, move the cursor near the Controls Island and click the eye icon again to switch it off.

</div>

## Move and resize

To move the main character window, drag the move button in the lower-right corner of the Controls Island.

<div rounded-lg overflow-hidden>

On Windows, you can drag the edges or corners of a window to resize it. Several common sizes are also provided in the tray menu:

1. Right-click the AIRI tray icon.
2. Open **Adjust sizes**.
3. Select **Recommended (450x600)**, **Full Height**, **Half Height**, or **Full Screen**.

**Align to** in the same tray menu can move the window to the center or four corners of the screen.

## Recommended settings to review

After your first chat, review these pages:

- **Providers**: Add or edit Chat, Vision, Speech, Transcription, and Artistry providers.
- **Modules**: Select services for consciousness, speech, hearing, vision, memory, Discord, Minecraft, Factorio, MCP, and other modules.
- **Models**: Switch between supported 2D/3D models, or import your own.
- **AIRI Card**: Switch the current character, or create a new character card.
- **System**: Set the language, theme, usage-analytics settings, and desktop-specific options.

Some modules are experimental and require local source configuration or additional services. See the [complete desktop manual](./setup-and-use/) for detailed instructions.
